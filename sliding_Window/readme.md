## Sliding window technique

Window Sliding Technique is a computational technique which aims to reduce the use of nested loop and replace it with a single loop, thereby reducing the time complexity.

This technique mostly used in arrays and strings.It is very most important techniques for interviews.

## steps involved in Sliding window technique

let us take one example like sum of subarray of k elements in an given array. 

- Input:[1,2,3,4,5]
        3
  Output: [6,9,12]
